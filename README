Description:

	Artificial Intelligence: CS 4300
	Project #2: Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe

	There are two players: evens: [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16] and odds: [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15].
	Playing on a 4x4 board, the goal is create a straight line of 4 cells (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) that sums to 34.
	Implemented in two ways: User vs AI, and AI vs AI.
	
Solution Method:

	The program implements a minimax algorithm to determine the best move at any given state.
	A state is represented with a 16-element integer array.
	
Environment:

	Developed using Eclipse IDE on Windows 10, using 64-bit Lenovo laptop.
	See Makefile for compilation details.

Files:

	main.cpp:				Main driver file.
	
	tictactoe.h: 			Declares structure for the TicTacToe class.
	
	tictactoe.cpp: 			Defines methods for the TicTacToe class.
	
Problem:

	Checking validity of user input may not be perfect.
